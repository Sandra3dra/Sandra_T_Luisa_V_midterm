			<h3 class="cats">UNIQUE CATS</h3>
      <p>I have a cat and a dog, but I prefer my cat than my dog. I have several reasons why cats are better than dogs.</p>

			<ul class="listsOfCats">
				<li>Cats are easy,cute, independent, and clean</li>
				<li>They go outdoors by themselves</li>
				<li>Expenses tend to be higher for dogs than cats</li>
				<li>Don't require to take training classes</li>
				<li>Cats use litter boxes for urinating or defecating,
				but I trained my cat to use my toilet. So, he doesnâ€™t need to use his litter box</li>
				<li>Cats have different moods</li>
				<li>Cats like to follow their owners around alike dogs</li>
			</ul>
